# Bills-Reminder-App
> Praise Olawuni
>> I am currently working on building an application that reminds the user of the currect bills that they have.

# Additional Notes
* I want it to be able to store all of the dtata on each bill and correctly output the closest upcoming bill that they have, with all the information about it.
* This idea came from having to manually put each bill that I have into my calender, and this doesn't necessarily favour the details of all the bills, so it would be ideal to have an application that stores this all in one place and is easier to input and display.
* I intend of applying this into a visual application for mobile & webpage.

# What I am using
* Object-Oriented approach: classes, methods.
* External data storage.
